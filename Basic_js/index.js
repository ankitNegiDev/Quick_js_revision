/**
 * js is for all the logical and interectivity part of a web-page (web-site)
 * js is programming language and it has feature like -- (capability of descision, task reptions, we can build our own logic, we can do computation and so on.)
 * thre are three way to execute js ---> (1) directly using browser console , (2) using node , (3) using html and linking js file and all output will be shown in browser console.
 * programme -> a file where we write our logical piece of code
 * process -> programm under execution is called process. whenever we run any program in our machine that become the process..
*/

// variable -> variable are used to store data during execution of program -- we can crate any number of varaible and these variable will be uniquely identified based on there name and using this varaible name we can  fetch , update and store data in the varaibles.

// inorder to create varaible we have let ,var,const..

// console is a object and log() is a function which is a property of a console object or we can sya its method of console object.
let variableCreatedUsingLet="bingolive";
console.log("let varaible is : ",variableCreatedUsingLet);
const variableCreatedUsingConst="secret-key";
console.log("const varaible is : ",variableCreatedUsingConst);

var variableCreatedUsingVar="some-variable-name";
console.log("var varaible is : ",variableCreatedUsingVar);

// varaible naming rule
/**
 * a varaible name can contain letter,digit,_ and $
 * variable name can start with letter,_ and $
 * varaible name are case sensitive
 * reserved word can't be variable name..
 * by default in js we use camelCase..
